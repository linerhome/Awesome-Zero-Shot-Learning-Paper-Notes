**Zero-data Learning of New Tasks** 

This is one of the most early ZSL papers, introducing the problem of zero-data(zero-shot) learning. A general formalization of zero-shot learning in this paper is well-defined.                                 

**methodology:** The methodology in this paper is hard to follow, especially nowadays in the era of deep learning.

**experiments:** In the experiment section, tasks of character recognition and multi-task ranking problem is are addressed in the context of zero-shot learning.

**Cold Start problem in recommander systems:** The paper points out that in the context of recommander systems, the cold start problem is a particular application setting of zero-shot learning.
